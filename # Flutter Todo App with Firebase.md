# Flutter Todo App with Firebase

This is a Flutter application that demonstrates how to build a todo list app with Firebase as the backend. The app allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks, as well as group tasks into categories.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/username/flutter-todo-app-with-firebase.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```
cd flutter-todo-app-with-firebase
flutter pub get
```

3. Create a Firebase project and add the following configuration to the `firebase_options.dart` file:

```dart
const firebaseConfig = {
  'apiKey': 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  'authDomain': 'YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN',
  'projectId': 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
  'storageBucket': 'YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET',
  'messagingSenderId': 'YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID',
  'appId': 'YOUR_APP_ID',
};
```

4. Run the app:

```
flutter run
```

## App Structure

The app is structured as follows:

- `lib/main.dart`: The main entry point of the app.
